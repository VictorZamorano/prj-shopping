This is in progress, so if you want to fix any errors or give me advice with the code, I appreciate it.

## how prj work

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Run nodemon and typescript => **npm run dev**

i need config the test later
<!-- - Ejecutar test => **npm run test**
